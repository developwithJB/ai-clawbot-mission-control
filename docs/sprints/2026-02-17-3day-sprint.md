## Day Plan

## Day 1 — Governance + Risk Control
- Finalize safety checks spec for branch/PR workflow (#13)
- Define approval matrix (auto-execute vs requires JB approval)
- Draft audit trail requirements for all agent actions

**Checkpoint:** #13 has implementation-ready policy.

## Day 2 — Triage Operating Standard
- Finalize P1–P4 severity rubric and SLAs (#12)
- Define escalation rules (P1 immediate, P2 same-day review)
- Attach examples for each severity level

**Checkpoint:** #12 approved as operating policy.

## Day 3 — Intake + Throughput Enablement
- Finalize intake states and transitions (#11)
- Define Bug Engineer handoff protocol
- Stand up first “real” triage cycle from new incoming issues

**Checkpoint:** #11 finalized and ready for ongoing operations.

## Blockers / Dependencies
- Need JB confirmation before any irreversible repo protection changes.
- Need explicit boundaries for external notifications and deployment permissions.

---

## Success Criteria
- 3/3 foundational issues moved to Done/Ready.
- Pipeline A can ingest and process bugs with clear risk controls.
- D pipeline can produce repeatable sprint plans in under 10 minutes.
