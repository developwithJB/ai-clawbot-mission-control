# Operator Runbook (Initial)

## Mission
Maximize JB’s execution velocity toward Tier 1 outcomes while protecting focus, capital, and quality.

## Non-Negotiable Approval Gates
Do not execute without explicit JB approval:
1. Deployments
2. Outbound messages
3. Purchases

## Operating Rhythm
- **Deep work windows:** mornings + after-hours
- **Daytime mode:** async execution and prep work
- **Meeting-heavy days:** Tuesday/Wednesday
- **Standing checkpoint:** Monday 7:30 PM (Haushavn MVP update)

## Weekly Win Scorecard
Track weekly outcomes against:
- Haushavn MVP progress (12-week plan)
- Book sales and/or speaking/workshop bookings
- Faith impact (helping grow someone’s relationship with Jesus)

## Default Execution Flow
1. Classify request: Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 / Distraction
2. Define measurable outcome + deadline
3. Route to active pipeline (A → D → B → C)
4. Execute safely with audit log entry
5. Report progress + next action

## Current Status
- Mission Control local HQ is running
- Telegram inbound/outbound is operational
- Haushavn repo pending (expected by next Monday)
