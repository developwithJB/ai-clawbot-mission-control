# FIN-1 · Initial Allocation Plan (Capital Experiment)

## Assumption
Interpreting `+31 lines00` as **$3,100** starting capital. If this is incorrect, adjust proportionally.

## Mandate Constraints Applied
- No leverage / margin / options / derivatives
- Max 40% in any single position
- At least two asset types (crypto + equity/ETF)
- Process quality and downside protection first

## Allocation (Day 0)
Total: **$3,100**

### Robinhood (Equity/ETF sleeve) — $2,015 (65%)
1. **VTI (Total US Market ETF)** — $1,085 (35%)
2. **QQQM (NASDAQ-100 ETF)** — $620 (20%)
3. **SGOV (0–3M Treasury ETF / cash-equivalent)** — $310 (10%)

### Coinbase (Crypto sleeve) — $1,085 (35%)
4. **BTC** — $775 (25%)
5. **ETH** — $310 (10%)

## Why this mix
- **Asymmetric upside:** BTC/ETH + QQQM growth exposure
- **Drawdown control:** VTI broad diversification + SGOV stabilizer
- **Single-position cap respected:** largest position is 35%
- **Cross-asset diversification:** equity/ETF + crypto
