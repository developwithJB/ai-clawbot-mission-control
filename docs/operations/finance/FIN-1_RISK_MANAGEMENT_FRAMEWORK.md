# FIN-1 · Risk Management Framework

## Core principles
1. Survive first
2. Position size is risk control
3. No thesis, no trade
4. Document every decision

## Hard controls
- **No leverage/margin/options/derivatives**
- **Max 40% per position**
- **At least two asset classes**
- **Stop rule:** if portfolio falls **30% from starting capital**, freeze new trades and start risk review

## Risk thresholds
- Soft alert: -10% from start
- Action alert: -15% from start (review allocations)
- Defensive mode: -20% from start (reduce growth sleeve by 10% and increase SGOV/cash)
- Hard freeze: -30% from start (no new buys, risk committee review)

## Platform controls
- 2FA enabled (authenticator app)
- No margin permissions
- Device/login alerting enabled
- Monthly access review

## Risk review checklist (on trigger)
- What caused drawdown (market beta vs concentration vs execution)
- Rule adherence score (0–100)
- Any unauthorized style drift
- Recovery plan before unfreeze

## Unfreeze conditions
- Written review completed
- Revised allocation approved
- Confirmation that all hard controls remain active
