# FIN-1 · 8-Week Operating Strategy

## Objective
Run a disciplined capital-allocation experiment emphasizing process quality, asymmetric upside, and downside control.

## Week-by-week
### Week 1 — Setup + Initial Deployment
- Execute tranche entries to target weights
- Baseline report (start value, allocations, thesis)
- Enable security controls on both platforms

### Week 2 — Stability Check
- No thesis changes
- Track drift + volatility + behavioral compliance
- Rebalance only if >5% absolute drift from target

### Week 3 — Risk Validation
- Review drawdown path and correlation behavior
- Confirm stop-rule readiness
- Keep trade count minimal

### Week 4 — First Monthly Review
- Compare actual vs target volatility and max drawdown
- Decide keep/trim/add within constraints

### Week 5 — Controlled Adjustment Window
- Allow one allocation adjustment (max 10% portfolio shift)
- Must document reason tied to framework

### Week 6 — Discipline Audit
- Audit adherence: no impulsive trades, no rule breaks
- If any rule breach, freeze discretionary changes for 7 days

### Week 7 — Scenario Stress Test
- Simulate -15% and -30% portfolio scenarios
- Validate freeze protocol and action checklist

### Week 8 — Experiment Review
- Score process quality, risk control, and return profile
- Produce recommendation: continue / modify / stop

## Operating cadence
- Weekly review: same day/time each week
- Max 2 discretionary trades per platform per week
- No ad hoc trade outside scheduled review unless stop rule triggers
